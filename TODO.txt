TODO

IMMINENT
-------------------

1. Find a common solution to absolute/relative paths (Solution: Boost::FileSystem)
2. User control (Solution: Boost::Program_options)
3. Think PulseWaves limitations and what can be added? 

LONG-TERM
-------------------

1. Decision on gui architecture and design (MVC, layered, etc.)
2. Narrow down core functionalities - pulse editing, filtered selection etc.
3. Can we include existing pulse decomposition code (RJMCMC) in to this framework?
